# Project Setup and Development

This README provides instructions on how to set up and run this project, along with information on how AI tools were utilized during its development and known limitations.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

    _(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the Git repository and `<project_directory>` with the name of the cloned directory.)_

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary Node.js packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following script:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## How AI Tools Were Used

AI tools played a supportive role throughout the development process:

- **Mock Data Generation:** AI models were employed to generate realistic-looking mock data for testing and prototyping purposes. This allowed for the development of UI components and functionality without relying on a fully implemented backend.
- **Accessibility Suggestions:** AI tools provided suggestions and insights on how to improve the accessibility of the application. This included recommendations on ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and color contrast to ensure a more inclusive user experience.
- **Debugging Assistance:** On occasion, when encountering bugs or unexpected behavior, AI tools were consulted for potential solutions and explanations. This involved providing error messages or descriptions of the problem to the AI for guidance and troubleshooting ideas.

## Known Limitations and Next Steps

While AI tools provided valuable assistance, it's important to acknowledge their limitations and outline the next steps for the project:

**Known Limitations:**

- **Mock Data Accuracy:** The mock data generated by AI, while helpful for initial development, may not perfectly reflect the complexities and nuances of real-world data. Integration with a real backend will be necessary for production.
- **Accessibility Coverage:** While AI provided accessibility suggestions, a comprehensive accessibility audit by human experts is crucial to ensure full compliance with accessibility standards.
- **Debugging Depth:** AI-assisted debugging can offer potential solutions, but it may not always identify the root cause of complex issues. Thorough manual debugging and code review remain essential.

**Next Steps:**

- **Backend Integration:** Develop and integrate a real backend API to replace the mock data and provide persistent data storage.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
- **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit with human experts and implement any necessary improvements.
- **Performance Optimization:** Analyze and optimize the application's performance for speed and efficiency.
- **Further Feature Development:** Continue to develop and implement the remaining features and functionalities of the application.
